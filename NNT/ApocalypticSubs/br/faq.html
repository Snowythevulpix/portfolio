            <h2>What made you start fansubbing?</h2>
            <p>Our group initally started fansubbing Seven Deadly Sins: Four Knights of the Apocalypse because netflix
                does not release offical subtitles until they release the dub. This means that for months the fandom
                would either have almost no idea what's being said or even a lack of being able to watch the episodes.
                That's where we come in and become the middle-man of sorts, providing subtitles where netflix wont.</p>

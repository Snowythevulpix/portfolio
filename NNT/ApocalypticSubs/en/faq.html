        <section>
            <h2>What made you start fansubbing?</h2>
            <p>Our group initally started fansubbing Seven Deadly Sins: Four Knights of the Apocalypse because netflix
                does not release offical subtitles until they release the dub. This means that for months the fandom
                would either have almost no idea what's being said or even a lack of being able to watch the episodes.
                That's where we come in and become the middle-man of sorts, providing subtitles where netflix wont.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How do i view the episodes?</h2>
            <p>There are two ways of viewing our subs that we support. These are either downloading from our release
                page or watching via our discord.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What do you think of X site uploading your subs?</h2>
            <p>While we do not recommend watching via these methods for a variety of reasons the rules of the seven
                sea's say these sites will exist no matter what we do.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>SuBs WeN</h2>
            <p>We do not give a release window for our subs. This is so we don't release a rushed or messy product. We
                ask you please do not constantly ask or be rude to our team members who are working on these subs in
                their free time. If you don't like it, tell netflix that. Not us.</p>

            <h2>Who are the people working on the subs?</h2>
            <p>Staff list and maybe a comment or so?</p>
